### Unresolved Problems and Major Hurdles
Getting Google login, passport and sessions working was a major hurdle, as well as getting bootstrap working correctly. Both of those stemmed from me just jumping into the situation half cocked. When I went back and read the docs from the beginning I was able to walk myself through the proceedure from teh start and came out with a much better understanding of the issues.
